Trac# mycode (Learn Gud)

A project desciption is supposed to go here but really just messing around while following tutorials and such as I attempt to learn this.

And now I have a project description through the terminal. So, yeah, let's see how that goes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine
for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project
on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Let's verify that Python 3.x is installed. The following command will ask the apt package manager (think Google PlayStore, only for Debian / Ubuntu), to ensure Python 3.x, and the Python 3.x package manager (pip), is also installed.

student@bchd:~$ sudo apt install python3-pip -y

On RedHat based systems, you would type, "sudo yum install python3-pip -y"

Launch Python 3.x.

student@bchd:~$ python3

Try out the print() function.

>>> print("Just testing")

Exit the environment with the exit function.

>>> exit()

Check on the version of Python 3.x installed without entering the Python 3.x environment.

student@bchd:~$ python3 --version

The latest Python builds for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux/UNIX are available at: https://www.python.org/downloads/

If you're writing code in a Windows environment, you might want to try out Notepad++, PyCharm, or Visual Studio. All of these tools will 'help' you write code.

Notepad++ (OpenSource) is available for download here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/

PyCharm (JetBrains) is available for download here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

Python for Visual Studio (Microsoft) is used by many students: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/python/

Anything you type in the Python interpreter is saved (written out when you exit()). Let's take a look at the python interpreter history file so far.

student@bchd:~$ cat ~/.python_history

Good job, that's it for this lab. Before proceeding, you might want to take a moment and install 3.x on your local machine. Note: If you are using a corporate laptop, it is possible that your local security settings will not allow the installation of Python.
